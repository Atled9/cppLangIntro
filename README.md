cppLangIntro

these are small projects that I wrote to learn
some of the C++ language

the "helloGit" file contains a git repository (".git" file).
I am aware that it isn't good practice to 
include another git repository inside a git
repository, but I just wanted to use this repository to
dump all my introductory practice files, so there it is anyways :3
